# GitHub Secrets Setup for Railway Deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Action Required: Configure GitHub Secrets

Your GitHub Actions workflow is failing because the required Railway secrets are not configured.

## üîë Required Secrets

You need to add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

### 1. RAILWAY_TOKEN (Required)
- **Purpose**: Authenticates GitHub Actions with Railway API
- **How to get it**:
  1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/account/tokens)
  2. Click **"Create Token"** or **"New Token"**
  3. Give it a name (e.g., "GitHub Actions Deploy")
  4. Copy the generated token (you'll only see it once!)

### 2. RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID (Optional but Recommended)
- **Purpose**: Specifies which Railway service to deploy to
- **How to get it**:
  1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
  2. Click on your service
  3. Go to **Settings** tab
  4. Copy the **Service ID** (found under "Service ID" section)

## üìù How to Add Secrets to GitHub

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**
   - Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI_ML`

2. **Open Settings**
   - Click on **Settings** tab (top right)

3. **Access Secrets**
   - In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**

4. **Add New Secret**
   - Click **"New repository secret"** button

5. **Add RAILWAY_TOKEN**
   - Name: `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste your Railway token
   - Click **"Add secret"**

6. **Add RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID** (Optional)
   - Click **"New repository secret"** again
   - Name: `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID`
   - Value: Paste your Railway service ID
   - Click **"Add secret"**

## üîç Verify Secrets Are Added

After adding secrets, you should see them listed under:
- **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **Repository secrets**

You should see:
- ‚úÖ `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
- ‚úÖ `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` (if added)

---

## üöÄ Re-run the Workflow

Once secrets are added:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Find the failed workflow run
3. Click **"Re-run all jobs"**

Or simply push a new commit:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment after adding secrets"
git push origin main
```

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Keep your Railway token secret
- Rotate tokens periodically
- Use different tokens for different environments
- Delete tokens you're no longer using

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Never commit tokens to your repository
- Don't share tokens in chat or email
- Don't use the same token across multiple projects
- Don't store tokens in plain text files

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Project Token not found"
**Solution**: Add `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret to GitHub repository

### Error: "Service not found"
**Solution**: 
- Add `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` secret, OR
- Remove the `service:` line from workflow file to deploy to default service

### Error: "Invalid token"
**Solution**: 
- Generate a new token from Railway dashboard
- Update the `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret in GitHub

### Deployment succeeds but app doesn't work
**Solution**: 
- Check Railway dashboard logs
- Verify environment variables are set in Railway:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
  - `PORT` (set to 7860)
  - `GRADIO_SERVER_NAME` (set to 0.0.0.0)

## üìã Quick Checklist

Before re-running the workflow, ensure:

- [ ] Railway account is created
- [ ] Railway project exists
- [ ] Railway token is generated
- [ ] `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret is added to GitHub
- [ ] `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` secret is added (optional)
- [ ] Environment variables are set in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Latest code is pushed to GitHub

## üí° Alternative: Deploy Without GitHub Actions

If you prefer to deploy directly without GitHub Actions:

1. **Using Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI
   npm i -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login
   railway login
   
   # Link to project
   railway link
   
   # Deploy
   railway up
   ```

2. **Using Railway Dashboard**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository
   - Railway will auto-deploy on every push

## ‚ú® What Happens After Setup

Once secrets are configured and workflow runs successfully:

1. ‚úÖ Every push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment
2. ‚úÖ GitHub Actions builds and tests your code
3. ‚úÖ Railway receives deployment trigger
4. ‚úÖ Railway builds and deploys your app
5. ‚úÖ Your app is live at your Railway URL
