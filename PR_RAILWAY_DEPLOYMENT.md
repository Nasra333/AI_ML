- Configured server to use environment variables:
  - `GRADIO_SERVER_NAME` (default: "0.0.0.0")
  - `PORT` (default: 7860)
- Disabled `share=True` for production security

**Before:**
```python
import gradio as gr
# ... rest of code ...
demo.launch(share=True)
```

**After:**
```python
import os
import gradio as gr
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
# ... rest of code ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server_name = os.getenv("GRADIO_SERVER_NAME", "0.0.0.0")
    server_port = int(os.getenv("PORT", "7860"))
    
    demo.launch(
        server_name=server_name,
        server_port=server_port,
        share=False
    )
```

#### 2. `requirements.txt`
**Changes:**
- Fixed PyTorch installation syntax for Railway compatibility
- Moved `--index-url` to separate line (pip requirement)

**Before:**
```txt
torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

**After:**
```txt
--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
torch
```

#### 3. `README.md`
**Changes:**
- Added `PORT` and `GRADIO_SERVER_NAME` to environment variables section
