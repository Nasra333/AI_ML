  "build": { "builder": "NIXPACKS" },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python app.py",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```
Railway-specific configuration for build and deployment.

#### **runtime.txt** (NEW)
```
python-3.11.0
```
Specifies Python version for consistent runtime environment.

Template file showing required environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- `PORT`
- `GRADIO_SERVER_NAME`

### 3. Application Updates

#### **app.py** (MODIFIED)
- ‚úÖ Added environment variable support
- ‚úÖ Configured for production deployment
- ‚úÖ Disabled `share=True` for security
- ‚úÖ Added proper server configuration

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Added imports
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Production configuration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server_name = os.getenv("GRADIO_SERVER_NAME", "0.0.0.0")
    server_port = int(os.getenv("PORT", "7860"))
    demo.launch(
        server_name=server_name,
        server_port=server_port,
        share=False
    )
```

#### **requirements.txt** (MODIFIED)
- ‚úÖ Fixed PyTorch installation syntax for Railway compatibility
- ‚úÖ Moved `--index-url` to separate line

### 4. Deployment Optimization

#### **.railwayignore** (NEW)
Excludes unnecessary files from deployment:
- Test files
- Development tools
- IDE configurations
- Cache files

#### **.dockerignore** (NEW)
For future Docker deployment option (if needed).

### 5. Documentation

#### **README.md** (UPDATED)
- ‚úÖ Added Railway deployment section
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step deployment instructions
- ‚úÖ Environment variable documentation

#### **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md** (NEW)
Comprehensive 200+ line deployment guide covering:
- Prerequisites
- Detailed deployment steps
- Troubleshooting
- Security best practices
- Cost considerations
- Monitoring and updates

#### **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** (NEW)
Complete checklist for deployment verification:
- Pre-deployment tasks
- Deployment steps
- Post-deployment verification
- Common issues and solutions

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app/)
2. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your repository

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
PORT=7860
GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0
```

### Step 4: Access Your App
- Railway will provide a URL
- Click "Generate Domain" in Settings ‚Üí Networking
- Your app will be live at: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
