  - Moved `--index-url` to separate line

- [x] **`README.md`** - Added Railway deployment section with step-by-step instructions

## üîß Configuration Summary

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key>
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-key>
PORT=7860
GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0
```

### Railway Build Configuration
- **Builder**: NIXPACKS (auto-detected)
- **Start Command**: `python app.py`
- **Python Version**: 3.11.0
- **Restart Policy**: ON_FAILURE (max 10 retries)

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Railway, ensure:

- [ ] All code is committed to Git
- [ ] `.env` file is NOT committed (already in `.gitignore`)
- [ ] API keys are ready (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- [ ] GitHub repository is accessible to Railway
- [ ] Railway account is created

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Connect Repository to Railway**
   - Go to railway.app
   - Create new project
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Navigate to Variables tab in Railway
   - Add all required API keys
   - Add PORT and GRADIO_SERVER_NAME

3. **Deploy**
   - Railway auto-deploys on first connection
   - Monitor build logs for any errors
   - Wait for deployment to complete

4. **Generate Domain**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Networking
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Access your app at the provided URL

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] All tabs load correctly
- [ ] Model selector works
- [ ] API calls succeed (test with each model)
- [ ] File uploads work (Study Notes tab)
- [ ] No console errors in browser

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Fails
- Check Railway logs for specific error
- Verify `requirements.txt` syntax
- Ensure Python version compatibility

### App Crashes on Start
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Check for typos in variable names
- Ensure API keys are valid

### API Calls Fail
- Verify API keys have no extra spaces
- Check API key permissions
- Ensure sufficient API credits

### Port Binding Issues
- Railway automatically sets PORT
- Ensure app reads from environment variable
- Default fallback is 7860

## üìä Resource Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Memory**: 512MB (recommended 1GB)
- **CPU**: 0.5 vCPU (recommended 1 vCPU)
- **Disk**: 1GB (for dependencies)

### Expected Build Time
- First build: 5-10 minutes (installing dependencies)
- Subsequent builds: 2-5 minutes (cached dependencies)

## üîê Security Notes

- ‚úÖ `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ API keys stored in Railway environment variables
- ‚úÖ HTTPS enabled by default on Railway
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets in code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to rotate API keys regularly

## üìà Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard
- **Deployments**: View deployment history
- **Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, network usage
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs
- **Settings**: Manage environment variables

### Application Health
- Check Gradio interface loads
- Test all AI model integrations
- Verify file upload functionality
- Monitor response times

## üîÑ Updating Deployment

### Automatic Updates
- Push changes to GitHub main branch
- Railway auto-detects and redeploys
- Monitor deployment logs

### Manual Redeploy
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" button
- Select specific deployment to rollback

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

### Railway Free Tier
- $5 usage credits per month
- Suitable for testing and light usage
- May sleep after inactivity

### Railway Pro Plan
- $20/month base + usage
- No sleeping
- Better performance
- Recommended for production

- [Railway Documentation](https://docs.railway.app/)
- [Gradio Documentation](https://www.gradio.app/docs/)
- [Project README](./README.md)
- [Detailed Deployment Guide](./RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## ‚ú® Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Test all features
   - Verify all AI models work
   - Check file uploads

2. **Monitor Usage**
   - Track Railway resource consumption
   - Monitor API usage and costs
   - Set up alerts if needed

3. **Optimize**
   - Implement caching if needed
   - Optimize model calls
   - Consider rate limiting

4. **Share**
   - Share Railway URL with users
   - Consider custom domain
   - Document any usage limits
